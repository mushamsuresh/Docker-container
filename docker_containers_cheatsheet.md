# 🐳 Introduction to Containers & Docker - A Beginner's Guide

## 📦 What is a Container?

A **container** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software — such as the **code**, **runtime**, **system tools**, **libraries**, and **settings**.

> 💡 **Analogy:**  
> Think of a container like a sealed **lunchbox**.  
> It has your meal (app), spoon (dependencies), and napkin (settings).  
> No matter where you take it — home, office, or an airplane — just open and eat. It always works the same way!

## 🐍 Docker Container Example – Python App

Let’s say you have a Python application that requires Python 3.11 and some libraries like Flask.

### ❌ Traditional Way (Without Docker):
- Manually install Python.
- Install Flask using pip.
- Cross fingers that it works the same on all systems.

### ✅ Docker Way:
You define everything in a `Dockerfile`, so your app runs *exactly* the same everywhere.

```dockerfile
# Use the official Python 3.11 image
FROM python:3.11

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy application files into the container
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

> 🔒 **Benefit**: Everything runs inside the container — isolated from your host machine.

### ✅ Docker Networking commands
docker run -d --name app --network bridge -p 8080:80 nginx     
## Bridge host network. It is like an apt building
docker run --network host nginx       
## Host network. It is like moving into a main house with no reception. easy access but less secure
docker run --network none busybox   
## You live in a completely isolated bunker. None network
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' my_container
## To find the docker container ip address which talk to internal containers. Not connected to external port.
ping host.docker.internal   or ipconfig  
## this will give the docker IPv4 address, which talks to external world.
 
## Note: Every container will have the same 8080:80 port only. Ex: container-1 port 8080:80, container-2 port 8081
like this we can differentiate the containers network.
